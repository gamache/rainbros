This is satire. Please put away your pitchforks and close tumblr.

It does not represent any political or social views. I have no clue what you'd deduce my views are from this, but I figured in this age of internet bullying, sensationalism, and bandwagon-jumping, it's better to be safe than sorry.

Again, this is a joke for the benefit of my coworkers.

No one was offended in the making of this. I know because I asked.
